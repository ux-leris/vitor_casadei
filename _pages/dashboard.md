<p class="lead lead-about">A dashboard is simply a way of showing multiple information at once.</p>

It should be an **easy to read**, real-time user interface, with the ability to display charts of the current status and historical trends of an organization.

*Mailchimp dashboard.*

This kind of application can be found in solutions like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/dashboard/) or [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com).

I was asked to work on a dashboarding solution that would **empower users** of Dassault Systemes solutions. The goal was to provide a *customizable* platform where users would be given access to a catalog of apps.

Apps would range from "progress report" to full "business applications".

*A user dashboard with apps.*

Users where separated into *roles*, based on which of Dassault Systemes [solutions](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/) they owned. Each *roles* were given a set of predefined dashboards and apps.

*A user filtering his dashboard.*

Some of the **benefits** of this solution included:

* Visual presentation of performance measures
* Ability to identify and correct negative trends
* Saves time compared to running multiple reports
* Gain a global visibility on the system
* Align strategies and organizational goals
