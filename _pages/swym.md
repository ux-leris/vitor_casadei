<p class="lead lead-about">Imagine an organization that is completely digitally connected.</p>

During my stay at Dassault Systemes, I was asked to participate in the development of an **in-house** enterprise social network. The goal was to start small then expand to other companies.

It seemed a **good idea at the time**, Facebook was racking up users by the millions and so everybody in the corporate world wanted a slice of the cake. Companies like [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), Jive, [Chatter](http://www.salesforce.com/eu/chatter/overview/), IBM or Microsoft jumped on the *bandwagon* and so we did too.

But of course, all this was before the enterprise world realized that **the best tool for the job** was the one people where [already using](https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-no-one-uses-the-corporate-social-network).

Nonetheless we went on and built our own little social platform. It was called **Swym** and it worked quite well.

## Swym
Instead of being user centric like our competitors, we leaned towards **communities**. A user would join a number of communities and interact with them through posts, images, wikis, questions or simply by reading articles.

*The first iteration of the news stream.*

All the communities he belonged to would be part of his news stream. He was then able to drill down inside any specific community.

## Features
Swym featured:

* Aggregated news feed
* A notification system
* A rich text editor (3d, image, videos, questions)
* Personal customizable spaces
* A site builder interface
* A per organization approach

## Tech
Swym was built using **Java** as a backend, a little bit of **node.js** for the notification systems and a lot of **javascript** on the front-end. It was mostly a *Single Page Application* (SPA) built with an **in-house** javascript framework.

Many teams were involved throughout the journey and it was a fun project to be part of.
