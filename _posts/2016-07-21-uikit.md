title: UIKIT style guide
desc: How a living style guide for Dassault Systemes came to be.
---

<p class="lead lead-about">
Living style guides are to front-end what well thought APIs are to backend. Essentials.
</p>

They are designed to aid in building **well-organized** documentation of front-end codebases. They details all the various elements and coded modules of a site or application.

Dassault Systemes needed to **unify its UI/UX patterns** and consolidate its front-end code. Furthermore they needed to document the *visual language*, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create their applications. It was a **one-stop place** for the entire team from product owners and producers to designers and developers to reference when discussing site changes and iterations.

## Iterations
The term *“living”* means its an **ever-going process**.

In the course of **3+** years I iterated over a style guide and delivered not less then three versions.

<h3>Version 1.0 <small>(2014)</small></h3>

*The copycat intro.*

*The Ext JS approach to components.*

<h3>Version 2.0 <small>(2015)</small></h3>
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/uikit-v2.jpg)
*Rethinking the hierarchy and usage.*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/uikit-v2-js.jpg)
*Buttons need buttons.*

<h3>Version 3.0 <small>(2016)</small></h3>
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/uikit-v3-home.jpg)
*The new home for version 3.*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/uikit-v3.jpg)
*Better colors and documentation.*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/uikit-v3-js.jpg)
*A more bootstrapy way to approach components.*

## Final thoughts
This work helped me grasp some of the issues inherent to style guides:

* releasing to early
* not involving all parties
* handling breaking changes
