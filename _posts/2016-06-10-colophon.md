<div class="lead lead-about">
This site is built using a number of **third party** tools and services.
</div>

Produced using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), my editor of choice for the last 3 years.

Published with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), managed through [Github](https://github.com/) and hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), while [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) acts as a CDN, protection and caching optimization.

Font files are delivered through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

* [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) by Cyreal
* [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic

Other notable tools are:

* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/clenemt/clenemt.com) for auto deploying the code on every Github commits
* [s3-website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) for deploying the Jekyll result to AWS
* [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) for testing the site for any discrepancies
